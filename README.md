<details>
  <summary>Calculator</summary>
  <p> This is a basic 4 function calculator I created, utilizing JavaScript to perform operations. The calculator can execute basic addition and subtraction, as well as multiply and divide.</p>
  </details>

<details>
  <summary>Pizza Menu</summary>
  <p>A simple menu I created using HTML and CSS, adding JavaScript for functionality. Users are able to mix different sizes and toppings to quote different prices. It automatically calculates a $1.00 discount to the overall price for the user as well, based up on the topping selections.</p>
 </details>
 
 <details>
  <summary>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</summary>
  <p>This project consists of a funny, yet basic tic-tac-toe game where the user plays against a computer. It randomly chooses who begins the game and then plays accordingly, complete with winning animation and comical sounds when interacting with the game itself.</p>
